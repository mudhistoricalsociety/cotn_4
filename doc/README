This is the README file for the Dystopia 1.2 codebase.

Please read all the .txt files located in this folder, most of
them contain information which is vital or useful.

** I have threaded the calls to new_descriptor(), this will cause the mud
   to run two processes, the second one doesn't use any resources, even though
   it claims to use the same amount of memory as the first (it shares the
   memory with the first process). There *could* be a slight problem with
   the threading, but so far I haven't noticed anything strange, and I
   usually run a rather well-packed mud (playerwise), so I doubt theres
   any quirks. (just a warning - the main error that could happen is freeing
   the same memory twice, I'm 99.9% certain that the status_ system prevents this)

** Theres a major lack in help files, it would be nice if someone would take
   the time to figure out exactly which help files are missing, and either
   write some of them or just report them to me.

** If you have trouble compiling the codebase, and get a compile error refering
   to -lz, then you are missing the ZLIB library, and need to get your sysadm to
   install this first.
