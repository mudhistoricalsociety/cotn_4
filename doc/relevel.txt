in kav_wiz.c you'll find a function called do_relevel(),
you'll have to edit this function to allow the creation
of immortals. Simply add the name of the players you want
to be immortals, and all they have to do is type 'relevel',
and their levels will be set to the respective numbers in
do_relevel().
