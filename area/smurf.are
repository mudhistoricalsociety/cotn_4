section of Smurfy Road.  You can go back to the smurfy well to the east.

Smurfy Road~
The last piece of Smurfy Road.  You can go back to Smurfy Road to the east.
A nice, beautiful, smurfy, mushroom home is to the south.  In the distance to
the north you can see Gargamel's Castle.

Smurfberry Patch~
Delicious smurfberries grow here.  You could probably eat a year's worth of
smurfberries in one sitting.  Smurfy Road is back to the west.  Another
smurfberry patch is to the north.

Smurfberry Patch~
Another patch of smurfberries is growing here.  The smell is driving your
nostrils crazy.  It almost, ALMOST, makes you forget all the singing going
on.  Smurfy Road is to the west, while smurfberry patches are to the north
and south.

Smurfberry Patch~
The northernmost of the smurfberry patches grows here.  It looks just
as scrumptious as all the rest.  Just take a few; they'll never know.  Smurfy
Road is to the west.  A smurfberry patch is to the south.

Brainy Smurf's Home~
You rip the roof of the home to get a good look inside.  You see
many smurfy books.  The print is so small you couldn't even read it
with a magnifying glass.  I wonder if Brainy Smurf minds if you
destroy his home?  Smurfy Road is back to the south.

Handy Smurf's Home~
This home was well built.  Of course, until you rip it apart you big meany
you.  Tools are all over the place.  Too small for you to use.  Smurfy Road is
back to the west.

Hefty Smurf's Home~
Hefty is anything but wimpy.  So is his house.  It actually took you a 
couple of minutes to destroy his house.  Better watch out -- he might be
a little mad at you.  Smurfy Road is back to the north.

Sleepy Smurf's Home~
Be vewy vewy quiet.  Sleepy Smurf is probably sleeping.  You see so many
beds you can't even tell if he is here.  Maybe you should quietly go back to
Smurfy Road to the east.

Grumpy Smurf's Home~
This is Grumpy Smurf's home.  He is pissed at you.  Of course, he is pissed
at everyone.  So don't take it bad.  Maybe you'd better leave before he really
gets mad.  Smurfy Road to the east is your only salvation.

Jokey Smurf's Home~
You pull the top of his house and it explodes in your face.  That Jokey
Smurf, what a kidder.  You can hear his laughter as you wipe the ashes off
your face.  You better get even.  Smurfy Road is to the north.

Papa Smurf's Home~
It's the home of the leader of the smurfs.  Papa Smurf has a nicely decorated
home.  He takes pride in his work.  You could get to know him or just squash
him.  If Papa Smurf is not here he is probably at Smurfette's putting the
moves on her.  A stone path lies to the north.

You are standing outside Gargamel's Castle.  You can hear him screaming at
Azreal from inside.  You can also him cursing out those wretched smurfs.
His Castle is to the north while Smurfy Road is to the south.

Smurfette's House~
This house is conveniently next to Papa Smurfs.  Makes it easier for Papa
Smurf to sneak over at night.  I hope he uses protection.  I would hate to
have little smurfs running around.  The only exit is to the east.
