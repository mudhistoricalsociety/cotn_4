0 expgroup expgroups~
Exp groups are pefectly legal of course. However this is how it pertains
to Ganging. If you're in a religion and exping with someone that is not and
a person with a religion attacks a member of that group, feel free to waylay
them. They should have thought of that before they attacked. The important
parts of hunting is timing and oportunity. 
 
However we will carefully watch for abuse. If a non-religion person is harassing you,
use bounty, it's why it's there.

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.

0 ARENA~
The rules in the arena are simple :

* No use of 'safe powers', meaning no going invis, objectform, shadowplane
  or any other power that leaves you safe from attacks.

To beat another player, you must tie them with the 'tie <players>' command,
and that player will be removed from the arena and given a restore.

Last man (or woman) standing in the arena will be the winner.

The arena opens every 2 hours for normal battles, all the normal
rules apply, and the winner gets a small prize. Some of these battles
will be for base classes alone. (you can type timer to see when the next
arena will be).

Currently we are working on some nifty arena commands, and so far we have
made these commands :

* Arenastats - Shows the stats on the people in the arena.
* Arenajoin  - Let's you join the arena when it opens (happens once in a while).
* Resign     - Give up, you'll leave the arena and get an arena loss.

AT works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

1 BULLY~
It's not considered nice to harrash players that are much weaker than yourself.
It is quite okay to mort and tie someone weaker than yourself if they talked trash,
killed your mobs or killed one of your friends, but it is not okay to constantly
harrash players that are weaker than yourself simply because you feel like it.

Should a player act like a real bully, a special bullyflag will be added to that
player. Anyone with a bullyflag will show as a bully on who and have a harder time
dodging and parrying. The bully flag will be removed when that player has learned
to act like a normal person.

(Whether a player is a bully or not is decided at the discression of the immortals,
trying to get the immortals to set the bully flag on someone will result
in the bully flag being set on yourself)

We hope never to actually set the bully flag on anyone, this is afterall a playerkilling
mud, and people should expect to be morted, tied and killed; but should harrashment be
taken to the extreme by a player, we will set the flag on the offending player.

~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

0 SHINOBI ~
#nA special note, this class can be selfclassed now, and you can leave the kingdom.

#0 The shinobi are a secretive group, loyal only to other shinobis. There are 6 types
of shinobi, Earth Fire Wind Water Holy and Shadow. Each element of shinobi has its own
agendas, but all groups work together as a whole. To become a shinobi, one must seek
out a Koge (Ko-gay) of whichever element you wish to pursue. That Koge will then
apprentice you, and your life as a shinobi will begin.

 The shinobi class is also considered a kingdom, and therefore all players within it
are treated as if they were in a kingdom. You can leave the Shinobi Kingdom once 
you become a shinobi, but you may never return to the kingdom. Shinobi powers are obtained
by learning 'handmotions' with the handmotions command. each level costing more and 
more primal each time to obtain. There are 6 handmotions in total for each element. A
good Shinobi must also obtain Chakra, the vital force of Spiritual and Physical energy.
A Shinobi's Rank is determined by how much Chakra they have, as well as their normal 
rank + upgrade + class powers obtained. To obtain chakra, a Shinobi only needs to meditate,
and stay mediting.

#0 The ranks for Shinobi are as follows:
#rApprentice: You start as this.
Genin: 100k hp/mana/move, 3000 chakra.
Jounin: 200k hp/mana/move upgrade 2, 6000 chakra.
Kage: 500k hp/mana/move upgrade 3, 10000 chakra.

#0 You can apprentice a person yourself, and if you do they get 3 levels automatically
in your element, and the first power in the ones surrounding it.

This is the breakdown for the elements:

		#RFire
	#oEarth		#0Shadow

	#7Holy		 #CWind
		#LWater#0

You gain all 6 powers for your element, the first 3 powers of the two
elements that are adjacent to that element, and the first power of the
two elements which are adjacent to those elements. So a fire shinobi
gains all 6 fire powers, the first 3 shadow and earth powers, and the
first holy and wind powers. The element opposite of yours you gain no
powers from, and your powers will negate theirs or harm them if you
are grouped. To see class powers, see:

-1 CRUSADERRANK~
#CThe Ranks among the Crusaders of The One True God#n

#GThe Neonates#n of the One True are the backbone of the army of light, and the most
common of the churchs followers. Trained for combat, they normally found fighting
the crawling chaos that is evil.

#GThe Peacekeepers#n of the One True are the elite warriors, ordained through the
trials of blood and horror that is the life of a true Crusader. These warriors have
seen it all; slaughtered demons by the thousands and faced horrors so old and perveted
that most men would die from the telling of the tale alone.

#GThe Inquisitors#n of the One True, are feared even by the hearthy and pure; these
grimfaces soldiers are the lawmakers and the judges of the One True. The word from
one of these alone can condemn an entire village to be burned to the ground.

#GThe Grand Knights#n forms a group of warriors within a world of warriors; these are the
special forces dispatched only to solve the most delicate of problems. Raised with the 
discpline and skill at arms that is the birthright of any Crusader, these men also show
great skill at subtlety and cunning. Do not underestimate the skills of these men in combat;
they may not start hacking at your with their mighty swords the first time you meet them,  
but you can be sure they'll track you down and slay you without even breathing hard, should
you utter a single word against the One True.

#GThe Crusaders#n are the the ruling council, and form the circle of of devotion to the
One True that is the basis of the church. These men are the are considered the closest
thing you can come to the One True, hearing the word of a Crusader is considered hearing

-1 CRUSADERS~
#CThe Crusaders of The One True God#n

The Crusaders are a sect of holy knights, paladins and noble warriors, who
fight for justice and the love of their One True God. By some the Crusaders
are looked upon as saviors, and by some as fools who have spend to much time
inside their metal armor, frying their brains. From a historical perspective,
we see the crusaders as an important force in the ongoing battle between
that which is considered good and fair, and that which is Evil. The Crusaders
have been the fuel to spawn many epic battles, and no history book is complete
without at least mentioning the legendary battle between the demonspawned
Nightlords and the Crusaders, where hundreds of Crusaders gave their life
in a succesful attempt to banish the Nightlords back to the planes of Hades.

Whether the Crusaders are right in their belief in The One True God (who is
commonly refered to as The Hand of Justice), or the God is just an excuse to
further the Crusaders own cause (which seemingly is to banish all Evil and
restore peace (whatever that means) in the realms), is not up for discussion;
you won't find a crusader talking about ethics or discussing the finer points
of beliefs and religion, but rather you'll find him on a horseback, swinging
his (or her) sword madly, hacking away at evil incarnated.

The worshippers oppose The Loa and The Crawling Chaos in the circle of balance.

If your kill a mob of the opposite alignment as yourself, fx. if your
aligned good and you kill an evil mob, you gain 25% extra exp from
the kill. BUT if your the same alignment as the mob you get 25% LESS
exp from killing that mob.

#GGuidelines about modifiers#n
* DO NOT ask immortals to turn on Happy Hour!
* Use #Ymccp#n to get the 25% extra exp, it helps the mud run smother.
    #RYou can use mccp with #YANY#R mudclient out there, please#n
    #Rread the help file on #Ymcclient#R if your normal mudclient doesn't#n
    #Rsupport mccp by itself. Mcclient is NOT a client, it simply helps#n
    #Ryour normal client so it can use the mccp protocol.#n
* If you for some reason don't get a certain modifier even though your sure
  that you should get it, please recheck everything, perhaps you shouldn't
  get it afterall.

1 FAE~
The Fae is an ancient races of faeriekin, that roam the planes of Limbo
and Gehenna. They are rarely seen in the mortal realms, but those who are so
lucky (or misfortunate, depending on what happens) to meet one of the Fae, will
have quite a story to tell their grandchildren. Do not let the Fae's diminished
stature fool you, they are indeed a force to reckon with, controlling the raw
energied of the plane, and conjuring powerful magics into existance with
the snap of a finger.

The Fae study the arts of Woodlore and ancient magics, and are devotees
of the disciplines of #GARCANE#n and #GNATURE#n (research and train commands to improve).

The four forces the Fae control are called plasma, energy, will and matter,
to unleash these energies, the Fae needs to channel these forces into existance,
using their own "bodies" as the vessel of creation. It should be noted that the
Fae doesn't have a real mortal form or body, but rather are beings of energy.
The Fae takes a mortal form upon entering our world, but they can reform this
body whenever needed, thus realising their stored energies and reforming lost
limbs.

The truly powerful of the Fae can reform their bodies into pure elemental form,
becoming a true Force of Nature. The only real important powers for a Fae
is #GInfuse#n and #GChannel#n, which let's the Fae summon and discharge the four
forces of the Fae.

Be warned though, Fae is a bit hard to play.

Prompt info : Special 1/2/3/4 are used for energies and
              Special 5 is used for faeshields.

~

0 'FAERIE FOG'~
Syntax: cast 'faerie fog'

This spell reveals all manner of invisible, hidden, and sneaking creatures in
the same room as you.
~

0 FASTDRAW~
FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

1 FIGHTTIMER FT~
On your standard prompt you will notice a section called 'ft',
this is your fighttimer. When your fighttimer is larger than
zero, then no room is safe, and certain powers will no longer
work. Also, the portal spell can be used against you, even
though you have the nosummon flag on.

You gain a fighttimer each time you do battle with another player,
and it will slowly drop outside combat.

~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax: cast 'fly' <character>

This spell enables the target character to fly.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
~

7 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

-1 FORGE~
#GForging rare metals onto your equipment gives extra hitroll and damroll#n

* copper = 3/3, iron = 6/6, steel = 9/9, adamantite = 12/12, mithril = 16/16
 
#GForging hilts onto weapons gives strange effects, depending on what spell the weapon had already.#n
#GShould a weapon not have any spell to begin with, the effect will be :#n

* ivory = curse       ebony  = blind   crystal   = dispel evil    marble    = drain
* gold  = lightning   bronze = acid    sandstone = fire           limestone = poison

#GForging equipment with gemstones will _replace_ the old spell affect and set the follwing instead :#n

* diamond = sanctuary   emerald = acid shield   sapphire = ice shield         ruby     = fire shield
* jade    = protection  pearl   = invis         topaz    = lightning shield   amethyst = fly
* onyx    = sneak       opal    = pass door     lazuli   = detect invis

syntax : forge <gem/metal/hilt> <item>

~

0 FORTITUDE~
Fortitude describes a type of supernatural toughness and vigor which
allows Kindred to resist harm.  Many vampires are very tough and are able
to withstand a lot of injury inflicted by weapons and spells.  However 
with the Fortitude power, they resist damage even further by often keeping
the weapons from harming them at all.
~

-1 FORTRESS~
This is a new arena system that lets you challenge other players to a spar or deathmatch

Syntax: Challenge <player> spar/death

Note: If you spar you don't lose or gain status

~

-1 GAHR~
#RThe Covern of Gahr, The Crawling Chaos#n

A long time ago, or so the legends tell (not much is known of Gahr before the Time of
Chaos) Gahr was a powerful god, revered by most of the other gods. Gahr was the god
of War, and dabbled a little in the arts of magic. As the story goes, Gahr got delusions
of Grandeur and called upon forbidden magic to enlargen his domain; something went awry
and the forbidden magic took a terribly toll on Gahr. His sanity. Unable to sustain his
immortal form, he became what is now know as The Crawling Chaos. An evershifting form
of tentacles, teeths and scorched fur. Without his sanity Gahr was unable to sustain
control over his wast domain, causing what is known as the Time of Chaos. The churches
of Gahr turned upon themselfs, and the worshippers died by the thousands in the war.
Today Gahr is mostly worshipped by the cruel and twisted, being the god of madness and
chaos he is also the god of slaughter and destruction, and many vile deeds are commited
in his name. Evil warlocks and other spellcasters often invoke the name of The Crawling
Chaos when powerful and destructive magic is called open, and many a sadist and murderer
is a member of the Covern of Gahr, The Crawling Chaos.

The Worshippers oppose The Crusaders and The Pantheon of the Wild in the circle of balance.

~

-1 GAHRRANK~
#RThe ranks in the Covern of Gahr, the Crawling Chaos#n

#GThe Slayers of Gahr#n are some of the meanest bastards that walk on two legs; born and breed
for the sole purpose of slaughter and destruction these vile creatures are known for their
savage fury and ability to hunt down any prey.

#GThe Diabolists of Gahr#n form the occult backbone of the Covern; these men and women drive
the followers of Gahr into a worshipping frenzy and are responsibly for channeling the powers
of Gahr into a destructive purpose. The Diabolists make most of the planning and thinking in
the Covern.

#GThe Eyes of Gahr#n are cursed with much the same madness as Gahr himself, these are speciel
worshippers, touched by Gahr, and infused with a part of the God. Driven mad and crazed by this
constant unholy presence inside them, they are feared not only by innocent, but also by many
followers of Gahr. They are known to act irrational, and strike out at anyone for no apperant
reason.

#GThe Voices of Gahr#n are a sorry bunch. Not much of the mortal that worshipped Gahr is left,
at least not of the sane mind that once possesed the body. These rambling, vulcanos of utter
power, unleashes raveging, destrutive forces upon buildings and mortals alike.

#GThe Abominations of Gahr#n are those that have undergone the final transformation and has
become a demonthing, avatars of Gahr himself they are sometimes called; like Gahr they seem
to have no control over their bodies, their limbs are hideously deformed, and their faces
and features are those of a demonic nightmare.

~

0 GHOUL~
#GG#chouls are powerful undead beings, once human, that arrise from the grave 
to kill again, and seek revenge on those whom have caused them harm in their mortal lives. 
These horrific creatures possess many supernatural powers from beyond the grave, and are 
very deadly in combat, although much stronger during the night hours.

Ghouls gain powers by expending GP (ghoul points). These points are gained by consuming 
the lifeless corpses of slain victims. If a ghoul happens to find and consume a brain, 
they receive bonus GP and hitpoints

1 GIANTS~
The Giants were the first to walk this world. In the beginning, before the gods
created man, and populated the worlds, the Giants would walk with the gods, they
were scholars and warriors, born and breed in the image of the gods. Then came
the time of man; humankin started walking the same earth the Giants had thought
their own for millinia; the time of the Giantwars started, and for many centuries
the children of the gods fought the onslaught of man. Finally the Giants, who had
always been few in numbers, lost, and retreated to the barren parts of the world.
Living in the wast wilderness, in the mountains and on the barren plains, the
Giants declined, both in numbers and in spirit, they became the race of Giants
we know today. The big and ugly brutes, that hates all of man. Few are those
that meet a giant and lives to tell about it, such is the hatred of the Giants.

1 GLAMOUR RESHAPE VTWIST CAMOUFLAGE~
Reshaping powers can be used to rename equipment, this is
the correct syntax to use for any of the reshaping commands.

reshape <targer object> [name|short] <new name>

name  : Changes the keywords of the item (that which you type to handle it)
short : This is the name shown, when you look at the item.

example for renaming a dagger to 'Purple Dagger'

reshape dagger short Purple Dagger

~

1 GNOSIS~
Gnosis is the power of the garou, and is used to power certain powerful
werewolf commands/powers. To regenerate your gnosis, you must be sleeping.

Training gnosis costs experience points, and the command 'train gnosis'
is used to increase your maximum level (the final max is 20).

~

0 GODLESS~
By typing this, you will no longer be affected by most god commands, 
including restore, force, slay, mset, transfer, deny, freeze, etc.  You 
can toggle your godless flag on and off at will, and everyone in the mud 
is informed each time you do this.

The following is a list of the user level commands commonly available to
players on IMC enabled muds. Note: You will need to meet the mud's minimum
level requirement before being able to access IMC. You will be notified
upon reaching the appropriate level.

imcchanlist: Lists the current channels on IMC and the levels at which they
  can be used. If you are able to see the output, then you can more than
  likely tune in to at least one channel.

imclisten [channel]: Lists the channels you are currently tuned in to.
  If a channel name is specified, then the command toggles the channel on or
  off for you.

imclist: Lists the muds which are currently connected to the IMC network.

See these general commands: IMCBEEP, IMCCHANLIST, IMCLIST,
IMCLISTEN, IMCREPLY, IMCTELL, IMCLOCATE, IMCFINGER, IMCQUERY, IMCWHO,
and IMCIGNORE

See these administrative commands: IMCCOMMAND, IMCDENY, 
IMCBAN, IMCPING, IMCSETUP, IMCSOCKETS, IMCSTATS, and IMCCONFIG
~

0 IMCBEEP~
Syntax: imcbeep person@mud     - "beep" a player over IMC

Sends a short sound tone to the person on the target mud. If their terminal 
program supports it, it will make an audible beep to get their 
attention. If you don't get a response, don't keep beeping. The person may 
be busy or away and spamming them will only tick them off as well as 
possibly leading to your IMC priviliges being revoked.

~

0 IMCCHANLIST~
Syntax: imcchanlist               - list all known IMC channels
        imcchanlist (channel)     - list details on one IMC channel

IMCCHANLIST displays information on channels active on IMC.
Without arguments, it will produce a display similar to:

Name            Local name      Owner           Perm    Policy
Hub01:ichat     ichat           Paradigm@Pabulu Imm     Open
Hub01:icode     icode           Paradigm@Pabulu Imm     Open
Hub01:pchat     pchat           Paradigm@Pabulu Mort    Open
Hub01:bridge1   ibchat          Paradigm@Pabulu Imm     Open
hub00:music     mchat           Xorith@SOR-Live Mort    Open
hub01:admin     iadmin          Paradigm@Pabulu Admin   Private
Hub00:00Haven   (not local)     Xorith@SOR-Live Imp     Private

This shows the channel's network name (eg. Hub01:ichat), the local name
 eg ichat - which can be used as an abbreviation in IMCSETUP, and which is also
the command to speak on that channel), the owner of the channel
(eg. Paradigm@Pabulum), and the channel's policy.

Channel policies available in version 3.22a are: open, and private.

Open channels can be seen and used by anyone meeting the mud's minimum level for IMC2.
Private channels can only be seen and used by the list of invited users.

If a channel is not configured locally, it will have (not local) for its local name.

If a channel is configured locally, but is not actually active on IMC2, it
will have an Unknown flag on it.

IMCCHANLIST with a channel name will provide detailed information on that
channel. For example:

Channel Hub01:ichat:
  Local name: ichat
  Regformat : [ichat] %s: %s
  Emformat  : [ichat] %s %s
  Socformat : [ichat] %s
  Perms     : Imm

  Policy    : Open -- Open to all muds
  Owner     : Paradigm@Pabulum
  Operators : remcon@pabulum paradigm@pabulum
  Invited   : 
  Excluded  : 

This displays the channel name, local name, policy and owner, as above. It
also displays:

- The minimum permissions needed on your mud to see the channel.

- The format for displaying messages from the channel. These can contain
  any color codes etc that your mud uses.

  Regformat is the string displayed when someone speaks normally on the
  channel - the first %s is replaced by their name, the second %s by what
  they say.

  Emformat is a similar string for emotes. Again the first %s is their 
  name, the second %s the text of their emote.

  Socformat is a similar string for emotes. Except there is only one %s and
  is the format used to send socials to the network.

- Any operators for the channel. This can only be changed by the owner of
  the channel. Operators can modify the 'invited' and 'excluded' fields
  via the IMCSETUP command.

- The invited and excluded people on the channel.

~

113 IMCCOMMAND~
Syntax: imccommand (command) (channel) [(data..)]
Common commands: create (channel)           - create a channel
                 refresh (channel)          - refresh channel data
                 list [(channel)]           - list available commands
                 destroy (channel)          - destroy a channel
                 policy (channel) (policy)  - change channel policy
                 addop (channel) (name)     - add a channel operator
                 removeop (channel) (name)  - remove an operator
                 invite (channel) (name)    - add an invited name
                 uninvite (channel) (name)  - remove an invited name
                 exclude (channel) (name)   - exclude a name
                 unexclude (channel) (name) - remove an exclusion

IMCCOMMAND is used to send commands to a channel daemon elsewhere on IMC.
It directly affects the channel itself - any changes made here will
affect all muds using the channel.

Since the actual commands are interpreted by the channel daemon, not your
mud, what is available may vary. To get a list of available commands, use
IMCCOMMAND list (nodename) for public commands, or IMCCOMMAND list
(node:channel) to see what commands you have for that channel.

IMCCOMMAND refresh asks the daemon to refresh your mud's information for a
channel, if it ever gets out of sync. Asking for a refresh of nodename:*
will refresh all channels on that daemon.

IMCCOMMAND create creates a new channel, with you as the owner.

IMCCOMMAND destroy destroys a channel. You must own the channel.

IMCCOMMAND policy changes the basic policy of the channel. You must be the owner.

IMCCOMMAND addop/removeop add and remove operators from a channel. You must
be the owner, and specify the operator's full user@mud name.

IMCCOMMAND invite/uninvite/exclude/unexcluded modify the invite and exclude
lists for a channel. You must be the owner or an operator on the 
channel. Either a full user@mud or a simple 'mud' name (no @) can be 
specified.

~

113 IMCCONFIG~
Syntax: imc <field> [value]

Configuration info for your mud. Changes save when edited.
You may set the following:

Show       : Displays your current configuration.
Localname  : The name IMC2 knows your mud by.
Autoconnect: Toggles automatic connection on reboots.
Minlevel   : Sets the minimum level IMC2 can see your players at.
Immlevel   : Sets the level at which immortal commands become available.
Adminlevel : Sets the level at which administrative commands become available.
Implevel   : Sets the level at which immplementor commands become available.
Infoname   : Name of your mud, as seen from the imcquery info sheet.
Infohost   : Telnet address of your mud.
Infoport   : Telnet port of your mud.
Infoemail  : Email address of the mud's IMC2 administrator.
InfoWWW    : The Web address of your mud, cannot contain tildes.
InfoDetails: SHORT Description of your mud.
Connectname: Name of the hub your mud connets to IMC2 on.
Connectaddr: DNS or IP address of the hub you mud connects to.
Connectport: Port of the hub your mud connects to.
Connectpwd1: Client password for your mud.
Connectpwd2: Server password for your mud.

The localname command set the IMC name of -your- mud. Use with care.

~

103 IMCDENY~
Syntax: imcdeny <person> <local channel name>
Syntax: imcdeny <person> [tell/beep/finger]

This command allows you to deny players the use of a local channel, the tell
functions, beep functions, and finger functions. It is a simple toggle that
can be changed as needed.

See also: IMC2
~

0 IMCFINGER~
Syntax: imcfinger (person@mud)     - get information about a player

Requests information about a specific person on the target mud. The mud 
will either respond with information they feel is appropriate, or with 
a message saying finger is not supported.

When used with the bridge, typing imcfinger (mud@i3) will produce a who
listing of the target mud.

See also: IMC2
~

0 IMCIGNORE~
Syntax: imcignore                  - list current ignores
        imcignore add <target>     - add entry to ignore list
	  imcignore delete <target>  - remove entry from ignore list

The IMCIGNORE command blocks all messages specifically directed toward an
individual user and is your first line of defense against an annoying pest.
You can specify individual users, or an entire mud using wildcards like so:

imcignore pest@mud
imcignore *@mud
imcignore pest@*

Before going to the mud's administration with a complaint, try this first.
If the particular person you are attempting to ignore continues to cause
problems or is becoming a nuisance to the mud in general, advise your mud
administration to seek the use of an IMCBAN command against them.
Be prepared to justify this with a good reason and provide any documentation
of any incidents your administrators ask for.

See also: IMC2
~

113 IMCBAN~
Syntax: imcban                   - list current bans
        imcban add <mudname>     - add mud to ban list
	imcban delete <mudname>  - remove mud from ban list

The IMCBAN command is used to stop an individual user, or an entire
mud from sending any traffic to your mud at all. This is your second line
of defense in the event individual user-level ignores fail to do the job
adequately for you. This is a somewhat drastic measure and should only be
used in elevated cases. In general it is best to have documented cases of
problems with individual users on your mud before resorting to this. All
incoming traffic from the offending mud is simply dropped and no further
action taken on the packets. If this level of action fails to stop the
problems you are having, document the incidents and proceed to the next
level and seek assistance from the hub administrator of the hub you are
connected to. They will be able to direct you further, and can issue
bans at the hub level if need be.

See also: IMC2
~

0 IMCLIST~
Syntax: imclist                  - get a list of active muds on IMC2

'IMCLIST' lists active muds on IMC2. It lists all the muds which this mud 
knows about on the IMC2 network, what client version they run ( or hub version
in the case of hubs ), what network they claim to be registered with, and what
hub they are routed from.

See also: IMC2 and IMCQUERY
~

0 IMCLISTEN~
Syntax: imclisten               - display current channel status
        imclisten (localname)   - toggle a channel

IMCLISTEN lets you show and toggle which channels you are listening
to. Without arguments, it will show you the channels you belong to; with
an argument, it will turn that channel on or off.

Any channels you listen to must be locally configured first - see
IMCSETUP. IMCCHANLIST can be used to see available channels.

See also: IMC2, IMCCHANLIST and IMCSETUP
~

0 IMCLOCATE~
Syntax: imclocate (person)          - find a player on IMC

specified player. If they are online and visible, a response will
be sent back indicating this.

113 IMCPING~
Syntax: imcping (mud)

IMCPING allows you to trace connectivity of another connection from your
own. As shown in the example below, you are given the amount of time in
milliseconds as well as the send and return paths. This example is a ping
from Pabulum to Alsherok.

Pabulum: 751ms round-trip-time.
Return path: Pabulum!Hub01
Send path:   Alsherok!Hub01

Keep in mind that the reported times may not be an actual representation
of how long the trip really took since this also counts the length of the
idle time the code took to process it.

0 IMCQUERY~
Syntax: imcquery (mud) (command)     - ask for information from a mud

IMCQUERY is similar to IMCWHO, except it requests different information 
from a mud. Each mud differs in what information it supplies. Typically
at least the following are supported:

help       - this list
who        - who listing
info       - mud information
list       - active IMC connections
direct     - direct IMC connections
config     - local IMC configuration
istats     - network traffic statistics
finger xxx - finger player xxx
wizlist    - Immortal list

113 IMCSETUP~
Syntax:
imcsetup setlocal (channel) (localname)   - locally configure a channel
IMCSETUP delete (localname)               - delete a channel
IMCSETUP rename (oldname) (newname)       - rename a channel
IMCSETUP regformat (localname) (format)   - change channel talk format
IMCSETUP emoteformat (localname) (format) - change channel emote format
IMCSETUP socformat (localname) (format)   - change channel social format
IMCSETUP level (localname) (level)        - set channel level

IMCSETUP allows you to change the local configuration of an ICE
channel. None of these commands have a lasting effect on the channel's
configuration on other muds.

IMCSETUP setlocal configures a channel. It connects the specified channel
(of the form nodename:channelname) to a local name.

For example: IMCSETUP setlocal Hub:IMCChat imcchat. The local name is also the
command used to speak on the channel.

When the channel is configured, default values are filled in for
regformat, emoteformat, socformat and level.

IMCSETUP delete removes this link. It does not affect the channel itself;
it just deletes the local configuration link for the channel.

IMCSETUP rename changes the local name of a channel. It does not affect the
channel name itself for other muds - just the command used locally to
access it.

IMCSETUP regformat, emoteformat and socformat change how a channel is 
displayed locally. Each format string must have exactly two %s's within it,
except socformat, (this is checked for) - the first will be replaced by the 
speaker's name, the second by whatever they say or do. Regformat is used for 
normal speech, emoteformat is for emotes and socformat is for socials.

IMCSETUP level sets the minimum level necessary on your mud to hear or use
the channel.

103 IMCSOCKETS~
Syntax: imcsockets                   - display IMC socket usage

IMCSOCKETS displays the current connection state for the direct IMC 
connections that your mud has. The various fields are:

Desc  : the system-level descriptor used for this connection
Mud   : which site this connection is for
State : how far through the connection process this connection is:
        - connecting: waiting for the other end to accept our TCP connection
        - wait1:      waiting for the password from an incoming client
        - wait2:      waiting for the server to respond to our password
        - connected:  the connection is completely 'up'
Inbuf : size of data waiting in the input queue for the connection.
Outbuf: size of data waiting in the output queue for the connection.
Spam1 : spam-protection counter
Spam2 : spam-protection counter

Note: This command now only shows you the data for your connection to the hub.
No other muds will be listed since this ability was removed for 3.10+.

113 IMCSTATS~
Syntax: imcstats                     - displays useful statistics

IMCSTATS shows some useful statistics about how much traffic your mud is 
generating due to IMC.

See also: IMC2, IMCLIST and IMCQUERY

0 IMCTELL IMCREPLY~
Syntax: imctell (person@mud) (message) - send a 'tell' to another player
Syntax: imcreply (message)             - send a 'tell' to the last player
                                         to send you a IMCTELL

imctell Name:MUD@I3 (message)          - Sends a tell to a person on the I3 network.

IMCREPLY will work on either a normal IMCTELL or one forwarded by the bridge.

A private message can be sent from you to a person on another mud.

To send a reply to someone who sent you a tell, simply use the
IMCREPLY command with your message.

Due to certain conditions within the network, your conversations COULD be
monitored, so don't send anything critical, like passwords or credit card
numbers ( or anything else you don't want to risk being snooped ), over an IMCTELL.

See also: IMC2
~

0 IMCWHO~
Syntax: imcwho (mudname)        - ask for a who listing from another mud

imcwho i3       - Shows I3 network mudlist.

Requests a list of the current players on the target mud. Invisble players 
will not be displayed. You should use the mud abbreviation listed in 
'IMCLIST' when issuing a IMCWHO.

1 GROWTH GIANTGIFTS~
By growing, a giant gains access to more powers, as well as increase their
fighting abilities in general (more damage, more toughness, more damcap).

Giantgifts are special gifts that can be used in combat. Some of them

sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work

to dwarves they share an unnatural toughness as well as a resistance to most
spells. The hobbits are mostly famous for their uncanny ability to cook anything.

of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~

1 HUNTER~
The dark hunter is a fierce beast from the lower layers
of the abyss. It's enhanced predatorial senses makes it
capable of hunting down any player in the world of dystopia.

To use the hunter, the summoner simply has to tell the
beast to start tracking someone by their name.

Example 'say start tracking Jobo'

The beast will then begin to track the player named
Jobo, and will not stop untill it has found him, or
have lost his trail (if the player leaves the area).

Please try to remember that the beast is still being
tested, and it might be a short while before it works
as it is supposed to - so no whining because he suck.

learned from Technique. Enter the moves in the correct order to do more         
and more damage. (The final blow of Combo 6 is a killer.)

0 LICH~
#n #n
Lichs are powerful sorceres that have cheated death by entering a state of
living death. No longer subject to the affects of time, they use their time
to explore other planes and perfect their magic. The lichs grow in power, far
beyond that of most mortal mages, since they have so much more time to perfect
their art. If you thought mages were scary, try fighting a lich that has used
the last 2000 years comming up with nasty spells to kill and destroy.

Masters of conjuring, death, life, necromantics and chaos, lichs have
acces to several powers, some of them are know as :

Conjuring   : Objectgate, Fireball, Planartravel, Golemsummon, Pentagram.
Death       : Readaura, Chillhand, Painwreck, Creeping Doom.
Life        : Regeneration, Earthswallow, Powertransfer, Polarity.
Necromantic : Zombie, Soulsuck, Planarstorm, Planeshift.
Chaos Magic : Chaosmagic, Chaossurge, Chaosshield.

Prompt info : Class special 1 will list the number of golems owned
              by the lich (which are in the same room as the lich).

-1 LOA~
#0What is the Loa#n

The Loa is not one person or being, it is something quite different, you
might call it a multitude of personalities mixed into one existance,
scholars have spent eons studying the few facts we have on the Loa,
but no real conclusion have come of it. Most of the scholars do agree  
on one thing. The Loa didn't create existance as we know it, but there   
seems to be no evidence of the Loa ever having been created itself, so
most people agree that the Loa have always existed in one form or another.

The Loa is also refered to as the snake god, or the Serpent; some religions
know of the Loa as the corruptor or the destroyer. Most religions agree
that the Loa exists, though they all expres a certain antipathy against
the followers of the Serpent god.

The different personalities of the Loa seems to be ignorant of eachother,
striving for different purposes and sometimes even fighting each other,
for a long time, the Loa was revered as several different deities, only
during the last few hundred years have the truth been know about the Loa.

The worshippers oppose The Stars and The Crusaders in the circle of Balance.

-1 LOARANKS~
#0What ranks are know among the Loa#n

#GThe Disciples of the Loa#n are the most common of the priests, they
are the backbone of the church, and the gatheres and brokers of the
churchs knowlegde.

#GThe Tongues of the Loa#n are the speakers of the divine truth, (at least
that's what the church calls them). These priests attain the special rank
of diviners and have acces to many of the secrets of the Loa.
 
#GThe Horses of the Loa#n are said to be possessed from time to time, by
one of the personalities of the Loa, from this possession springs both
madness and knowledge, some say that it's the divine knowlegde that causes
the insanity.

#GThe Vessels of the Loa#n have melted with the Loa, and are considered  
avatars of the great existance, these beings are rare indeed, and what
powers they have acces to is uknown.

#GThe Loremasters of the Loa#n is a secretive group that leads the church,
the numbers and power of these people are unknown, and it's even
speculated that the Loremasters are the Loa itself, manifested in mortal
form to lead it's church.

~

-1 LOARELICS~
#0Ancient Relics of the Church of the Loa#n

#R* #GThe bones of the Loa#n The ancient rod of communication with the
                      gods, whom we know now to be the Loa. Holding
                      this rod allows the wielder to know everything
                      the Loa does, or at least one of it's personalities.

#R* #GThe Serpent Staff#n    Wielded by the high priet of the Church of Loa,
                      last location unknown. It's powers are likewise
                      unknown, though it's rumored that certain
                      Loremasters have knowledge of atleast its powers.

#R* #GAncient tomes#n        Written by ancient loremasters, most lost forever.
                       These tomes are said to contain knowledge that
                       allows a reader to gain a deeper understading of
                       the existance we call the Loa. Though most of
                       these works are know to cause insanity by merely
                       skimming the cover.

-1 LOAWORSHIP~
#0What do we know about the worshippers of the Loa#n

These shadowcloaked people seems to strive on secrecy and information;
it's commenly said about secrets, that if the children of the Loa doesn't
know it, no one ever will. Because the priest of the Loa keep every little
piece of knowledge they got from everyone else, it's almost impossible
to get any information about that church of the Loa, it's even said that
most of the priests don't know the full truth about the agenda of the Loa.

1 'LOCATE OBJECT'~
This nice spell, allows you to locate any object on the mud. By giving
the name of the object as the argument to the spell, the spell will list
the first 44 objects that match your argument. If you wish to see more
than just the first 44 objects, you can give an additional argument X to
the spell, so it will skip the first X objects.

example : cast locate sword 30

This will list up to 44 swords, and their location, skipping the first
30 swords encountered on the mud.

~

0 'LOCATE OBJECT'~
Syntax: cast 'locate object' <name>

This spell reveals the location of all objects with the given name.

7 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.

SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

1 MASTERY~
When you have grandmasterd all your stances, spells and weapons,
you can use the mastery command to gain a mastery item, which
is a piece of classeq that's better than your normal classeq.
Mastery doesn't require that you max your superstances, nor
does it require that you have more than 200 in weapons/skills
if that's possible. Getting 200 is enough.

syntax : mastery

NOTE : If you are so stupid that you gemstone your mastery item
       it's your loss, don't expect anyone to care.

~

1 MCCP~
Mccp is a compression protocol, and the two main benefits of mccp are:

1. lower bandwidth usage by the mud.
2. clients (i.e. players) get large responses (such as, for example, combat
   spam) from the mud at a higher rate - the mud will "feel" faster, despite
   the fact that the actual round-trip times are unchanged.

With a suitable client, mccp is entirely transparent to the user - it
automatically enables itself when supported by both the server and client.

For more details on the protocol, your welcome to visit the MCCP homepage

#Ghttp://www.randomly.org/projects/MCCP/#n
 
Currently the following mud clients are know to support mccp.

* Papaya
* Tkturf
* Mcl
* Amcl (cvs only)
* Kmud
* Zmud (version 6 only)
* Mushclient

If you use mccp, you will be rewarded by an extra 25% exp bonus.

-1 MEETING~
#RThe meeting#n

As you stumble down the dark corridor, you come upon the form of a humanoid creature,
it doesn't look very menacing nor threatening, but as you get closer you see how wrong
you really were. Though the create looks slim and scrawny, the face is horrid beyond
reality, grey ashy skin, and huge black voids for eyes, all set into an empty expression
that marks the face in a way more horrid than the tentacles that surrounds the mouth
or the dark fluid that runs from the open sores on it's body. As you stumble to a halt,
a sense of vertigo falls over you, and the world around you change to something not quite
real, but not quite a fantasy; as if the settings was wrought from your innermost
memories, just that this is nothing you have ever experience, more like your worst
nightmare; the nightmare you had once, but have forgotten, pushed into the darkest
parts of your mind.... the nightmare comes alive, and a hulking creature stands infront
of you - the same creature that was once the scrawny humanoid you met in the corridor,
somewhere far far away. Now you know.... know for sure.... the nightmare has just begun.

What these dronelike creatures really are, is something no one really knows. Their unnatural
behaviour, and the fact that no known habitat have ever been found (on any plane) calls for
the conclusion that these creatures don't really exist, but infact are figments of our
imagination, some dark, twisted, perverted version of our darkest fears.

not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.

A monk's chi is the essential part of combat.  The higher
the monk's chi, the better he or she can parry and dodge
blows.  It also gives the monk more strength and power,
thus letting him or her inflict more damage and receive
less.  Maintaining chi is very strenuous, and requires
that the monk have plenty of vitality.
~

0 MONKCOMBO~
By using his or her special techniques, such as thrust kick,
in a certain order, he or she may perform special combos.
Each combo has a different effect.  Some may do damage to the
victim, some syphon movement points, and some may stun the victim.
A monk's combos are a very mysterious thing, thus the monk
must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.

Lightning Kick - Strikes the opponent with a series of powerful kicks.
Tornado Kick   - Strikes everyone in the room with kicks.
Choyoken       - A devastating attack that targets the opponents stamina.
Raptor Strike  - An attack that syphons the mystical energies of the target.
Nerve Pinch    - A series of attacks targeted at central nerves, paralysing.

1 MSP SOUNDS MUSIC~
MSP stands for Mud Sound Protocol, and it's a way of allowing muds
to use sounds and affects to increase the fun of mudding.

As far as I know, only wintin and zmud has support for MSP, but
should you know of any other clients that supports the sound
protocol, you can mail the admins of the mud, and they will add
it to the list of clients.

You can either download all the sounds first (that's probably
the smartest thing to do), or let your mudclient download them
when they are needed (it will only download them once, and then
reuse the downloaded sound next time it's needed).

Sounds are found at :

www.mindcloud.com

Just type 'sound' to toggly sounds on/off.

QSTAT shows you the special properties and strings on an object.
~

1 MULTIPLAYING PLAYERSHARING~
Multiplaying and playersharing is strictly forbidden, the rules
are as this (and don't try and find loopholes, I'll just wipe you).

* No more than 1 char can connect via 1 ip, so local networks
  don't work, unless you have more than one ip available.
* Going linkdead to trade items from one char to another is not
  allowed, it still counts as multiplaying.
* Having more than one person controlling a character on the mud
  is called playersharing and it not allowed.
* No transfering of items and/or qps from one char to another
  that you own, read HELP RULES on how I deal with people who
  think they found a loophole.
* No using one of your characters to help another in some way
  or another. Be smart, keep your characters seperated.
* If an immortal tells you to stop multiplaying, you will stop
  instantly, there will only be given one warning, next time
  ANYONE multiplays from that ip, ALL chars from that ip will
  be deleted.

Don't argue, if an imm tells you that your multiplaying, then
you are. We don't give a shit if it's your mother that controls
the other character.

  #R*#n If you don't know how a thing is done, try seeing if their is a help file on the
    subject, if there isn't we could use one, and your welcome to write it and mail it the staff.

Good luck, and all that :)

1 'NIGHT PACT' 'DEMONIC PACT'~
These two pacts will help the ninja do more damage, and also
help the ninja resist more damage. Without committing to these
pacts, the shadow ninja will never reach it's full potential.

~

0 NINJAS~
Ninja's are warriors trained in the dark art of Ninjutsu.  They fight
using stealth and quickness making them a deadly foe.  Ninja's have few, yet
powerful powers at their disposal, and when these powers are mastered a 
ninja can be a most powerful adversary.  Through stealth a ninja can sneak
upon a victim and do a deadly amount of damage, and if this is not enough
they can slink away and hide in the shadows.  However, if you try to run
from a master ninja you shall find yourself hard pressed to make it out
alive.

It is vital for a ninja to focus his or her Ki, this is done with the command
'michi'. A ninja CANNOT regen while not in a state of michi. Ninjas are   
ranked with a system of belts. Each belt adds more punch to the ninjas
abilities in combat, meaning more damage, better dodge, more attacks, etc.
Belts can be trained with the command 'train beltX' where X is the current
belt that the ninja wish to learn.

Read help on principles.

1 OBEAH~
Obeah is the most useful of vampire disciplines, and allows the vampire
to wear equipment and cast spells while in zulo/dragon form, and it
grants access to a powerful healing skill called 'purify'.

~

0 OBFUSCATE~
Kindred with this Discipline excel at hiding among and away from crowds.  
When they do not wish to be seen, others rarely notice them even if they 
are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

<<*>> #rMask#n Allows you to disguise yourself as another player.
<<*>> #rShield#n Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
<<*>> #rMortal#n Switches between vampire and mortal mode.  While in mortal 
      form, you loose all vampire advantages and disadvantages, and are 
      undetectable from a normal mortal.
<<*>> #rVanish#n allows the player to be invisible to the common eye.
<<*>> #rConceal#n This power hides any object it is used on.

the plane of shadows at will.  They may also view things in both planes 
simultaneously if they so wish.

<<*>> #rShroud#n This power is an advanced hide.
<<*>> #rShadowsight#n This power allows you to see in the Umbra.
<<*>> #rNightSight#n This power allows the kindred to see in the dark.
<<*>> #rShadowstep#n This allows you to step through the umbra without
      being seen and appear in front of your victim.

0 Pentagram~

#0- [#RP#re#0n#Wt#Ra#rg#0r#Wa#Rm#0] -#n
They are One. They have existed since the beginning, the Shattering,
etching out a living in the deep forests of the land.
Nature and arcane practices are guarded jealously among their ranks,
for they have long been dwellers of the forests and keepers of mystic
secrets. Overseeing them is the fabled Finvarra Turendae, who controls
the aspect of chaos. Chaos is held precious in their ranks.
It's eternal torment extinguishes life in the blink of an eye, but clears
the way for new life in it's aftermath, pure and innocent in it's rebirth.

And so, are the members of #RP#re#0n#Wt#Ra#rg#0r#Wa#Rm#n reborn in their
initiation, stripped of their old beings and bathed clean in the fires
of redemption.

The members are beings shrouded in mystery. At the center of their existence
rest secrets too great to be believed, rituals too sacred to be spoken, and
knowledge too great to be shared. It is said, that upon being initiated, all
this overwhelms and often drives a person mad. However, sanity is relative.
Those of the order, find it useless, and even a hindrance to maintain
conventional sanity. They are known for their bizarre humor, insane sense
of logic, and immense power.

~

1 PARADOX~
When a player decaps someone not in their statusrange, they get paradox'ed,
which means they end up morted in midgaard, which really isn't healthy.

The statusrange works in this way :

A player with 0 status can only be beheaded by a player with 0 status,
else the beheader will be paradox'ed. A player with more than 0 status
can be beheaded by any player with NO MORE than 5 more status than
that player (fx. a player with 11 status can be beheaded by a player
with max 16 status), but a player will NEVER be paradox'ed for beheading
a player with 20 or more status.

This means that your free for all when you reach 20 status,
and is no longer protected by paradox rules.

0 PROTEAN~
This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

      wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
      enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can

1 QGAIN QCOMPLETE QUESTMASTERS~
A new quest system is in town, and the old one is out. Here is
a short list of commands used (for more details you should read
the quest help on my homepage).

qgain <questmaster>       - gain a new quest from a questmaster.
qcomplete <questmaster>   - get the prize for completing the quest.
showquest                 - lists all quests you are doing.

An example: Find a questmaster, type 'qgain <name of questmaster>',
then type 'showquest'. In this example we will assume that the
quest is a quest to find and slay a specific monster. After finding
the monster (it will have a quest-flag next to it's name), return
to the questmaster and type 'qcomplete <name of questmaster>'. The
questmaster will give you a questtoken, which you should eat, it
will increase your questpool.

~

7 QTRUST~
Syntax: qtrust <character> <on/off>

A player with qtrust on is allowed to use the QUEST command to change the 
name/long/short descriptions on an object, as well as change the wear 
location.
~

0 QUEST TOKEN~
Syntax: quest <field> <value>
Syntax: token <value>

QUEST will allow you to spend any quest points you might have.  For a 
list of the cost (in quest points), type 'quest'.

TOKEN will allow you to create a quest token, with the value of the token 
set to the value specified.  The tokens value must be within 1 and 50, 
and it cannot be greater than the number of quest points you currently 
have.

For information on the QUEST spell, type 'help questspell'.
~

0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~

0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.

0 QUIETUS~

~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

-1 RAGNAROK~
#0RAGNAROK MODE#n

When time comes, the world will sunder and the gods will walk the earth
spreading havoc and destruction, this is a time of slaughter, and no one
will be safe, this is the age of Ragnarok.

Using the command 'mudstat' you'll be able to tell if ragnarok is on,
if it's not, you'll just get the normal mudstat screen.

Doing ragnarok the following changes are in effect :

* There are no safe rooms.
* Everyone has scry, and it bypasses all shields.
* You can decap anyone, anywhere. (no paradox).
* Heads will vanish faster.
* Players will auto train avatar and get a restore.
* You do not lose ANYTHING if capped during ragnarok.
* You are safe for 3 ticks after training avatar. (to rewear)

player can turn on ragarok buy pooling qps toward it, using
the ragnarok command. ie. 'ragnarok 200' will add 200 qps
to the ragnarok pool (currently 3000 qps is needed to turn
on ragnarok). mudstat will show how many qps is still needed,
and ragnarok cannot be turned on for two hours after it has
last been on.

Ragnarok lasts 15 minutes.

Enjoy

1 RELBUY RELPOWERS~
It is possible to buy certain religion powers for the faithpoints you gain
from killing other players (and in particular those from opposing religions).

Though all priests have access to the same powers, the cost of the powers differs
from religion to religion. A member of the church of The One True would have to
pay more for the power to induce madness, whereas one of the Gahr worshippers would
have to pay more for the power of Divine Fury. As a player grows in rank inside
his or her church, the more expensive powers will start to cost less faith points
to gain. When a player types 'relbuy' they get a list of powers they can buy,
those that are colored WHITE are the powers in the players sphere, whereas those colored
GREY are located in the spheres of other gods. All power can be bought, but the cost
will depend on the players rank and religion.

A players faith points are divided into two. One number is the total amount of faith
that player has achived (which decides rank), and the other is the amount of faith
that player has left to buy powers for.

The cost for a given power is 20 fps per rank, this cost is doubled if it's a power
from a sphere the priest doesn't normally have access to. Should a priest try to
achive a power which is beyond his or her level (religion rank), then the price
is again doubled. (The prices listed on the relbuy list is the actual price you
need to pay).

syntax : relbuy <power>

Also take a look at HELP RPR1, RPR2, RPR3, etc.

~

-1 RELIGION FAITH BELIEF DEITY~
The known religions of Mindcloud :

Five deities or pantheons are known to be worshipped throughout the realms
known as Mindcloud; the followers of these godly beings are among the finest
of warriors, the very best Mindcloud has to offer. To join one of the five
churches or cults, you must first master yourself, then you may pledge
alligiance to one of the churches in 'The Halls of Enlightenment'.

As a follower of one of the churches, you must pay a tithe of 5% of the
exp you earn; but for this tithe you gain acces to some of the special
powers, that only the true believers can master. Ofcourse no simple neonate
gains acces to the most powerful commands of the gods; first they must
climb the hierachy within their own church walls, and find the divine favor
of their deity.

When you kill other players, you gain faithpoints, these points represents
how much status you have within the chuch. For each 100 faithpoints you gain,
you also gain a rank in your religion. If you go below the required faithlevel
you will lose the rank again.

The amount you gain is modified by this :

Killing playes with a higher rank than you will give more faith.
killing players that are bigger than you will give more faith.
Killing playes that oppose your religion will give more faith.

You don't want to get killed because :

Getting killed by opposing religions will lower your faith.
Getting killed in general will lower your faith a little.

Read more about RELIGIONPOWERS and DEITIES.
~

1 RELIGIONPOWERS HOLYSYMBOL~
As you grow closer to your god, you gain acces to more gifts granted by your deity,
these are known to be, but not limited to :

Personal login/logout messages.
Personal decapitate messages.

There will also be powers that depend on what deity you worship, but that's all
to come later, lot's of work to be done.

Current religion commands :

* reltalk      - Faith talk channel
* worship      - Worship a god (ONCE)
* settie       - Sets your tie message    (HELP SETTIE)
* setdecap     - Sets your decap message  (HELP SETDECAP)
* setlogin     - Sets your login message  (HELP SETLOGIN)
* setlogout    - Sets your logout message (HELP SETLOGOUT)

        RESETS <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESETS <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESETS <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

0 SAMURAI~
The Samurai is an ancient warrior and master of armed combat. 
A samurai must train for a long time before his true potential can
be released. Once he has masterd the fighting weapons however, few 
can stand up to such power. Also the samurai is protected from most 
magiks by the spirits of the ancestors. Beware, the samurai may appear
as only mortal, but much power resides in these warriros of old.

ancestralpath -  Class portal.
technique     -  Start using the ancient fighting techniques.
katana        -  Create the only weapon you'll ever need.
web           -  These buggers have been know to throw webs at the opponent.
martial       -  Command to learn the combos.

Also read help on SAMURAICOMBO.

affect the samurais focus a bit.

Slide         1 point
Sidestep      2 points
Block         4 points
Countermove   8 points

When the samurais focus hits 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 35 he or she will
be allowed to make a special attack (auto).

When not fighting the counter will slowly drop, while fighting, the
samurai can use the focus command to make it drop.

The focus counter can be added to the samurais prompt with the %k
flag, read help prompt for details.

8 SEDIT~
Syntax:

sedit delete         <social>
sedit new            <social>
sedit show           <social>
sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent to
the involved characters.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyoune but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X types
HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:

$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.

So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editting of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.

1 SETLOGIN SETLOGOUT SETAVATAR SETTIE SETDECAP~
With these commands you can set the message other players gets when you enter
or leave the game, as well as train avatar. Each time you set this message,
you must pay 1000 qps.

you shouldn't have any trouble following them.

* No profanities in the message.
* No referring to any of the immortals or other players besides the possibly victim.
* I'll remove your ability to change your messages if you abuse this in any way.

The syntax is easy, heres a few examples :

settie $n grins in triumph as $e ties up $N.

Heres the syntax :

  $n  This is your name.
  $N  This is the name of the possible victim.
  $e  Results in he/she depending on your sex.
  $E  Results in he/she depending on the victims sex.
  $m  Results in him/her depending on your sex.

0 STANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

how deadly that player is in combat.  Each time you decapitate an 
Immortal+ (or an Avatar if you are also an Avatar) your status goes up by 
one and their status goes down by one (to a minimum of zero).  The 
following shows how many kills (minus deaths) you need for each status:

Remember, if your status is Immortal or above you gain nothing for 
decapitating an Avatar (except a free loot, a head, and an enemy).

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.


f these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 TIE UNTIE GAG BLINDFOLD~
Syntax: tie <target>
Syntax: untie <target>
Syntax: gag <target>
Syntax: blindfold <target>

TIE allows you yo tie up another player, who must be stunned, 
incapitated, or mortally wounded.  While tied up, a players actions are 
limited - they cannot move, quit, or do many other commands.

UNTIE will untie a player who is currently tied up.  A player cannot 
untie themself.

GAG places a gag over the mouth of the target player, who must first be 
tied up.  This command will also remove a gag.  A player can only remove 
a gag from themself if they are no longer tied up.  It is not possible 
to talk or use any of the channels while gagged.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.  
A player can only remove a blindfold from themself if they are no longer 
tied up.  Unsurprisingly, blindfolded players cannot see.

-1 TIER TIERS~
TIERS
#W__________________________________________________________________________________________#n
#wWhat they are:  #0Basically Tiers represent how powerful of a god you are.
                  #0There are ten total tiers (not counting tier 0, which really
                  #0doesn't qualify as one).  Tiers are trainable, and appear on
                  #0train #Cand #cscore.  #CAlso, by typing viewtier, you will be
                  #0able to see everyone elses tiers, and their status.
                  #0Basically, the higher tier you are, #Cthe more powerful you are.#n

#wPurpose:	  #0Tiers are here to provide many benefits to players who PK,
                  #0However, their main purpose is to stimulate PK by opening up
                  #0an incredibly broad range for player killing that is somewhat
                  #0more balanced.#n

#wWhat they do:     
		#R* #0Allow extended PK (see rules below)
                #R* #0Allow for higher status accumulation
                #R* #0Boost your damcap
                #R* #0Give good xp modifiers
                #R* #GYou get a bonus multiplier equivalent to your tier level
                #R* #0They're required for improving your class

#wHow do I train them?
                  #0Typing #Rtrain #0will show you the requirements for your next tier.
                  #0Once those requirements are met, you can train your tier by typing
		          #0'#Rtrain tier#0'.  #0Your current tier and tier kills can also be viewed
		          #0on score.  Remember though, before you train make sure you are ready
		          #0to handle more intense PK on the next level!  Also remember, at higher
		          #0tier levels, if your current status drops too low, your tier will be
		          #0dropped!!!#n

        #l*#LA note on getting tier kills...
               #LIf i see you feeding players/letting people cap you/other plays letting you
               #Lcap them, i will set your tier to 0.  Don't think i won't catch you.#n

-1 TIERPK~

#GWhat are tier kills? How do i get them??
     -#gTier kills are points you aquire by making a valid decapitation.  Each time
      #gyou do so, you will gain One tier kill.

#RWhat Constitutes a valid decapitation?  How do the Tier PK paradox rules work?
     -#rA valid decapitation is any decapitation you don't get doxed from, and
      #rwould gain status from.
     -#RHere is how tiers work...
         #R*If you are Tier 0, normal paradox rules apply to you.  So if you cap
          #Rsomeone out of the 5 status range who is in Tier 0, you will be dox'd.
          #RHowever, if you cap someone in a higher Tier, who has more then 1 status,
          #Rno penalty or paradox will occur, even if they are out of range.
         #R*No matter WHAT Tier you are, if you ever cap someone with 0 status, and
          #Ryour status is greater then 0, you will be paradox'd.
	 #R*If you are Tier 1 or greater, you may cap anyone else in your same
	  #RTier, or in a higher Tier reguardless of your status range to them
          #R(as long as their status is greater then 0!)
	 #R*However.. You may not cap anyone in a #rLOWER #RTier, unless they are in
	  #Rthe status range of 5.

Syntax: train <slash/stab/smash/beast/grab>
Syntax: train <charm/heat/cold/lightning/acid/sleep/drain/voodoo>
Syntax: train <hurl/backstab/kick/steal/disarm>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class.  You can increase 
your attributes by spending experience points (exp) at a trainer.

It costs 200 exp to train a stat (str, int, etc), except that it costs 
only 100 exp to train your primary stat.  Primal costs 500 exp for the 
first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and 
hp/mana/move cost your current amount in that particular area minus your 
con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or 
an avatar costs 1000 exp each.

You can also train weapon resistances (reduces between 1 and all of the 
damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have 
any affect on you).  These cost 10000 exp for the first, 20000 for the

on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their

to daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for
blood.  If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will

0 VOODOO~
Syntax: Spell:   cast voodoo <victim>
        Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
First, a body part of the victim is needed.  The caster should hold this 
part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.
~

1 VT100~
If your client supports the vt100 protocol, you can make your
prompt stay at the bottom of your screen permanent. This is
done by typing 'vt100' while standing in a safe room. The mud
will then talk to your mudclient, asking it for your screen
size. If your client responds, the mud will figure out where
on your screen it should "trap" your prompt.

To disable vt100, simply type vt100 again (this can be done
anywhere, so you don't need a safe room for this).

1 WARLORD~
The Warlord is a powerful mob, which is able to actually behead players.
Taking out The Warlord is not easy, and it usually requires teamwork.

The Warlord gives 5 million experience points to every single member
of the group that kills him, and he is usually carrying some powerful
and useful items.

Beware The Warlord.

~

1 WARPS~
All warps are automatic, so you don't need any commands to activate them, just the command
obtain to get new warps. Theres a total of 18 warps, some have an affect, others don't.

These are the possibly warps :

Your body is protected by a indestructable crystal shell.
Your skin is as hard as steel.
Your arms are incredibly strong.
Your legs are incredibly strong.
Your tongue is long and venomous.
Your tail fires deadly spikes during combat.
Your breath is putrid and deadly.
You have incredible speed.
You have increased stamina, reducing the damage you take.
Your heightened senses enable you to hunt people. (*)
You have the ability to devour your opponents, sending them into the pits of Hell. (*)
Your features are so horrid that they may stun those who look at you. (*)
Your body has the ability to regenerate incredibly fast.
Your mounts transform into hideous Demons. (use the mount spell)
You have the power to transform into a deadly battle axe. (*)
Your body is composed of deadly magma.
Your skin is covered with shards of ice.
A pair of leathery wings protrude from your back.

The warps with (*) doesn't have any affect, and some of the warps are
used together with inparts or disciplines, most are just extra attacks
in combat or extra toughnes.

Maybe some day when I have some spare time, I'll clean up the demon powers,
but currently you'll just have to live with the mess.

1 WHO~
Typing who will show a list of the players online that you can see, using the following style :

#p  Title#n      #Y(#Gx.xx#Y)#n     #0<<#RCLASS#0>>#n         PlayerName

* The Title is based on the players size, and who is sorted somewhat after this.
  The lowest title is 'Wannabe' and they cannot kill nor be killed by other players.
  If your a wannabe and want to pk, then you need to grow in size first, this is
  done by either training more hitpoints or training more skills (weapons, stances, etc).

* The (x.xx) is the pkratio of that player, and the colors around the numbers shows
  whether you can kill that player and if she/he can kill you, heres the deal :

  if the #R()#n's are red, that means you can #Gboth#n kill eachother.
  if the #0()#n's are black, that means that the player can #Gkill you#n, but you can't kill him/her.
  if the #Y()#n's are yellow, that means you can #Gkill them#n, but they can't kill you.
  if the #B()#n's are blue, #Gneither#n of you can kill eachother.

* The Class and PlayerName are obvious.

* The religion tag will show what god/deity that player worships, and will also show
  the rank of that player within the given Church/Coven.

Enjoy!

-1 WILD~
#GThe Pantheon of the Wild#n

The Pantheon is formed by the three gods of nature, each controlling a their of the
world. Wind, earth and water divided amongst them, they fight the onslaught of
civilization, and the scourge of mankind. Few are the followers of the Pantheon,
but those few are the most devoted of worshippers, fighting their own kind to
let nature rule the realms of Mindcloud once more. There are no real churches to
the Pantheon, rather small shrines are erected whereever the followers travel.
The Pantheon doesn't allow their worshippers to settle, rather they are encouraged
to travel the wilds, preaching the words of nature, and fighting those that abuse
or hurt the nature in any way. The core of worshipping The Pantheon is allowing
yourself to be truly free, relinquishing property and material desires, living
from day to day, in perfect harmony with nature.

The Worshippers oppose The Stars and The Crawling Chaos in the circle of balance.

Read help on WILDRANK.

-1 WILDRANK~
#GThe ranks in The Pantheon of the Wild#n

#GThe Weeds of The Wild#n are the most common of the worshippers; they call themselfs
the weeds to indicate that even weed have more right to exist than man. Living with
nature, and protecting it mankind is the first principle of the weeds.

#GThe Hunters of The Wild#n live in harmony with nature, and has become a part of the
big circle of life, feasting of the riches of nature, and finally dying so that nature
can feast on them, completing the circle. These people are much feared, for they themselds
fear nothing. Rebirth is the main structure in the belief system, and those that fear
not dying, have no reason to fear anything.

#GThe Protectors of The Wild#n have risen from the ranks of the worshippers of the Wild,
and taken upon themselfs to protect the nature from those that does not understand.
Death to mankind and their beloved cities are one of many cries that can be heard
while The Protectors savegely demolishes a manmade city.

#GThe Harmonists of The Wild#n are those that have begun their sojourn. A journey unlike
many others, for this journey starts from within and ends within. As The Harmonist
explore his or her own essence and belief, and find his or her place in the world,
they evolve beyond that of normal man, becoming truly one with their beloved nature.

#GThe Forces of The Wild#n are those that have survived the passage within, and have come
to terms with who and what they are. The Forces are no longer considered to be a
part of mankind, but are rather revered as elemental forms, creatures who have risen
from the slavery of the flesh, and has chosen to fight beside nature as a part of it,
instead of protecting it from the outside.

0 I3~
Syntax: i3 <option>

Note: You must meet the mud's minimum level requirement before accessing I3.
You will be notified when you have reached the approptiate level.

General Usage:
------------------------------------------------

List channels available                : i3chanlist [all] [filter]
To tune into a channel                 : i3listen <localchannel>
To see who is listening on another mud : i3chanwho <channel> <mud>
List muds connected to I3              : i3mudlist [filter]
Information on antoher mud             : i3mudinfo <mud>
Ignore someone who annoys you          : i3ignore <string>
Make yourself invisible to I3          : i3invis
Toggle I3 color output                 : i3color

i3chanlist: Lists the channels the mud has available to listen to.
  Specifying 'all' will list the channels for the entire network.

i3listen  : Tunes you in to the specified channel. You must meet or
  exceed whatever the minimum level is for that channel to do so,
  and your mud must have the channel configured locally.

i3chanwho : Shows you who is listening to the specified channel on the
  specified mud. Invisble players will not be shown.

i3mudlist : Lists the muds which are connected to the network.
  Specifying a filter will narrow the list down to only those muds
  whose information matches. IE: &Wi3 mudlist afk&D will list all
  muds who have &Wafk&D as part of their listing.

i3mudinfo : Lists the information provided by the specified mud.

i3ignore  : Allows you to selectively ignore all contact with person@mud.
  This will block tells, beeps, locates, fingers, emotes, and whos. It will also
  block channel output from them, but will NOT block them from seeing YOU on
  a channel.

i3invis   : Makes you invisible to I3. Performs similar to the ignore option
  except it prevents EVERYONE on the network from finding you. You will still
  be able to use channels, and you will NOT be invisible to others if you
  do so.

See these general commands: I3TELL, I3FINGER, I3EMOTE, I3LOCATE, I3WHO, I3IGNORE

See these administrative commands: I3UCACHE, I3USER, I3BAN,
I3SETUP, I3CHANEDIT, I3CHANLAYOUT, I3ADDCHAN, I3REMOVECHAN, I3CHANADMIN,
I3CONNECT, I3DISCONNECT, I3PACKETDEBUG, I3CONFIG
~

103 I3UCACHE~
Syntax: i3ucache

Displays the current content of the mud's ucache data. This is a very spammy list
since multiple muds support this information and send packets out regularly.
Ucache data is used for gender targetting of socials.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

103 I3USER~
Syntax: i3user@mud

Sends out a specific request for the target user's ucache data and updates the
data tables accordingly.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

103 I3PERMS~
Syntax: i3perms <user>

Displays the permission level for the target user on the mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3PERMSET~
Syntax: i3permset <user> <permission>

This command sets the permission level for a particular user on your mud.
The following permissions are available:

Notset - Default value. Causes subsequent logins to reset perms based on level.
None   - No access.
Mort   - Allows access to channels and commands for non-staff players.
Imm    - Allows access to additional channels and commands for regular staff.
Admin  - Allows access to additional channels and commands for administrative staff.
Imp    - Allows access to additional channels and commands for implementors.

These permission values are also used when setting channels up for access.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3SETCHAN~
Syntax: i3setchan <i3channelname> <localname> [permission]

This creates a local copy of an existing I3 channel for the mud to subscribe to.
You must use the I3 name of the channel so that your mud will know which one you
want. This is obtained from the 'i3chanlist all' command. You must then supply
a local channel name to use with it. Then you can optionally set a permission level
at which players can start using the channel. Channels with no permission level
supplied will default to "Mort".

An example:

i3setchan diku_chat dchat mort

Available permissions are: None, Mort, Imm, Admin, and Imp. See I3PERMSET for more
information on what permissions do.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3EDITCHAN~
Syntax: i3editchan <localname> localname <new localname>
Syntax: i3editchan <localname> level <permission>

This allows you to change the local name of a channel, or to change the permission
level at which players can begin using it.

Available permissions are: None, Mort, Imm, Admin, and Imp. See I3PERMSET for more
information on what permissions do.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3CHANLAYOUT~
Syntax: i3chanlayout <localchannel> <layout> <format...>
Layout can be one of these: layout_e layout_m

Format can be any way you want it to look, provided you have the proper number of %s tags in it.

layout_e designs require 2 %s tags, one for the channel localname, and one for the message itself.

layout_m designs require 4 %s tags. One for the channel localname, one for the username, one for
the mudname, and one for the message itself.

Formats with incorrect amounts of tags will be rejected.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3ADDCHAN~
Syntax: i3addchan <channelname> <localname> <type>

The channelname should be what shows up on the router's list and is displayed
on the 'i3chanlist all' command.

Localname should be the local name you want it listed as on the mud.

Type can be one of the following:

0: selectively banned
1: selectively admitted
2: filtered - valid for selectively admitted ONLY

Selectively banned channels are public channels, open to all.
Selectively admitted channels are private channels, by invite only.

Filtering is not yet implemented in this client code, but is used to scrub
the content of a private channel by its host before it is sent out to those who are
subscribed. As noted, this CANNOT be done on a public channel ( yet ).

New channels default to "Mort" permission.

See I3PERMSET for more information on what permissions do.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3REMOVECHAN~
Syntax: i3removechan <channel>

Channelname should be the name seen on 'i3chanlist all'

Removed the indicated channel from the router, and deletes the local copy from the
mud as well. This does NOT send a broadcast to subscribed muds to delete their local
copies, so they will need to do that themselves upon noticing the channel is gone.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3ADMINCHAN~
Syntax: i3adminchan <localchannel> <add|remove> <mudname>

This command is used to administer the list of muds authorized to use a channel.

When used with a public channel, "add" bans them from using it, and "remove" unbans them.
When used with a private channel, "add" allows them to use it, and "remove" disallows them.

This is all handled on a per mud basis.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

103 I3CONNECT I3DISCONNECT~
Syntax: i3connect
Syntax: i3disconnect

Pretty self explainitory. Each option does exactly what it implies.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3DEBUG~
Syntax: i3debug

When this option is on, all packets entering and leaving the mud are logged so
that they can be inspected later. This is really only of any value in the
deployment of new packet types that have not been tested, or in the addition of
new features that have yet to be implemented. It is not to be used lightly, for
it spams and is a gross invasion of privacy for anyone on the mud who may be
using tells. Responsible admins should either inform their users ahead of time or
use this option on a development port.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3CONFIG~
Syntax: i3config <options>

The interface to changing your configuration while in the mud.
Most options listed by typing in the command cannot be changed if you are currently
connected to I3 and they will inform you of this.

'i3config show' will list the details of what you can currently change with this
command. If something is not listed, then the only means to change it is to edit it
in shell. The output of the command should be fairly self explainitory.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

113 I3BAN~
Syntax: i3ban <target>
Syntax: i3ban IP:Port

This is the mud-wide version of an I3IGNORE command. Best used in elevated cases
where indivudual users have been unable to effectively block traffic from another
user or mud who is harassing them, or harassing multiple users on your mud.
This is a somewhat drastic measure and all traffic from the individual user or
mud will be dropped silently. It is usually best to have documented cases of
individual abuse before proceeding to this level. If blocking at this level fails
to stop the problem, you may wish to proceed to the administrator of the channel
if the problem is channel related, or directly to the router administration for
the router you are connected to if it's something else. Be prepared to provide
any necessary documentation of incidents if the administrator you contact should
request them.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3IGNORE~
Syntax: i3ignore <target>
Syntax: i3ignore IP:Port

The I3IGNORE command blocks incoming traffic directed at a specific user on the mud.
It also prevents them from being displayed on such lists as who, and channel who.
This is your first line of defense against an annoying pest.
You can specify ignores either specifically or with wildcards, like so:

i3ignore pest@mud
i3ignore *@mud
i3ignore pest@*
i3ignore IP:Port

The IP type of ignore can only be specified as an IP and port, taken from the mud's
current mudinfo data. This will block anyone current and future who logs into that
mud IP and port from ever sending you traffic.

Before going to the mud's administration with a complain, you should attempt to make
an ignore work for you. If the particular person is still causing problems or is
making a nuisance of themselves to several people, advise your mud administration
that they may need to pursue an I3BAN against the person or mud in question.
Be prepared to show proper documentation of any incidents to support your case.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3BEEP~
Syntax: i3beep <person@mud>
Syntax: i3beep [on]/[off]

i3beep sends a quick message to a person on another mud.
If the target mud supports the beep tone, then the person
on that mud will hear the standard beep tone used by whatever
client software they are using. Works in the same manner as
the local beep command.

Using on or off as an argument will enable or disable your ability
to send and receive i3beeps.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3EMOTE~
Syntax: i3emote <person@mud> <message>

Sends a private emote to a person on another mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3FINGER~
Syntax: i3finger <person@mud>
Syntax: i3finger privacy

Request for information regarding a player on another mud.
Operates in a similar manner to the local 'finger' command.
Will only reveal information the target mud feels is appropriate.

Using the privacy argument will disable your information from being
sent to a requesting user on another mud. You will not be told anyone
has tried.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3LOCATE~
Syntax: i3locate <name>

Asks all the muds on the Intermud-3 network if a person
known by the name is there. Be patient when using this command,
there are a lot of muds on the network to search through, so
a response may take some time to come back.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3TELL I3REPLY~
Syntax: i3tell <person@mud> <message>
Syntax: i3tell [on]/[off]
Syntax: i3reply <message>

i3tell sends a private message to a person on another mud.
To send a tell to someone on a mud with a multi-word name, you need to
enlcose person@mud in quotes, like so: i3tell 'person@mud with long name'
Otherwise this command operates in much the same way as the local tell command.

To reply to the last i3tell you received, simply type 'i3reply'
followed by your message and it will be sent back to the last
person on I3 who sent a tell to you. Works in the same manner
as the local reply command.

Using the on or off arguments will enable or disable your ability to send
and receive i3tells.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3WHO~
Syntax: i3who <mud>

Requests an overview of players on a different mud.
Operates similarly to the local who command.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 INTERMUD3~
Intermud-3 is a protocol which allows you to chat with people on
other muds who are also connected to Intermud-3. It is primarily
populated by LP based muds at this time, but the hope is to get
more Diku based muds to join over time. While some may say that
Diku based muds would be better served on the IMC2 Network, it
is far easier for a mud to obtain a connection to the Intermud-3
network, and the commands to use it are generally simpler.
In either case, should a mud desire it, Intermud-3 will coexist
peacefully with an IMC2 enabled mud.
