The Spirit~
The spirit of the mud school is here to help you.
~
He is the spirit of a once-mighty player killer, who was forced to 
repent his sins after death by helping young newbies for a hundred and 
one years, after which time his soul will be allowed eternal peace.

He can conjure up Black Shimmering (breastplate, helmet, sleeves, leggings, 
gauntlets, boots, bracer, longsword, buckler, ring, collar) backpack, and 
war banner. He also knows a few good area for new players...Maybe you should 
ask him about the smurf village, the gnomes, the shire, or the dwarven 
drop-off centre?

Welcome to combat training.

The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command 'CONSIDER' to
consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
easily.

The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room down.
He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go 'DOWN' from
here, then 'CONSIDER' him, then 'KILL' him.  After a while, type 'FLEE' to
escape from him.

You can also set your character to flee automatically with the 'WIMPY' command.
Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about 'WIMPY'.

After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on
to the next station, go 'WEST'.

Welcome to the cage room.  The adepts of mud school have captured some
monsters for you to kill.  In the four cages are four monsters of various
types.  Kill them all!

After you kill each monster, get all of the equipment from their corpses
with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'.  You can then use the command 'WEAR ALL'
to wear your newly won equipment.

When you are done with the corpse, 'SACRIFICE CORPSE' to give it to your God.
God will reward you for this.

Between combat, you may need to rest or sleep to regenerate hit points.
You can 'REST' to regenerate hit points, or you can 'SLEEP'.  'SLEEP' will
refresh you faster than 'REST', but you will be less aware of your
surroundings.

you notice that this is NOT a great place to go.  Exits go in all directions.

Welcome to Hatchet's Guild Room.  Here you will learn your skills and spells.
To find out what skills and spells you can practice and how many practice
sessions you have, type 'practice'.  To practice the specific skill, type
'practice <skill>', where 'skill' is the skill or spell you wish to practice.
Practicing increases the amount you know of that skill or spell, up to a
certain maximum.  When you have practiced all you wish to practice, go west.

A Safe Room~
You are in a safe room, away from all the mean rabbits and snails of the Arena.
You can rest here, and go up to go back to the Temple of Midgaard.
